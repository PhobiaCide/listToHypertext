# listToHypertext

## Scenarios

Let's break down the expected output based on different scenarios that demonstrate how the script can handle various combinations of ordered and unordered lists, as well as blank lines, and abbreviations to generate the appropriate HTML output.

The "listToHypertext" function is designed to convert plain text lists into HTML lists. It handles various scenarios with ordered and unordered lists, blank lines, and abbreviations, generating the appropriate HTML output. Let's break down how the function operates in different scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Input Text with Consecutive Ordered List
- If the input text contains lines with consecutive numerals and periods (an ordered list format) followed by lines without numerals or periods, the output will be an ordered list followed by simple list items.
- Blank lines will be ignored.

### Scenario 2: Input Text with Non-Consecutive Ordered List
- If the input text contains lines with numerals and periods that are not consecutive (an ordered list format) followed by lines without numerals or periods, each group of ordered list items will be treated separately as ordered lists.
- Lines without numerals or periods will be simple list items.
- Blank lines will be ignored.

### Scenario 3: Input Text with Unordered List
- If the input text contains lines with asterisks as bullet points (an unordered list format) followed by lines without any bullets, the output will be an unordered list followed by simple list items.
- Blank lines will be ignored.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Ordered and Unordered Lists with Blank Line
- If the input text contains a mixture of ordered and unordered list items, along with a blank line separating them, the output will have both ordered and unordered lists, along with simple list items.

### Scenario 5: Mixed Ordered and Unordered Lists with Multiple Blank Lines
- If the input text contains multiple blank lines between different list items, the script will treat each group of ordered or unordered list items separately, followed by simple list items.

In all scenarios, the script distinguishes between ordered and unordered lists based on the presence of numerals or asterisks at the beginning of the lines. Blank lines are treated as separators between different lists or simple list items.

The function essentially takes a plain text input and organizes it into well-structured HTML lists, making it easy to present and style the information on a web page. This can be especially useful for content creators and web developers looking to convert plain text lists into HTML for web content.
